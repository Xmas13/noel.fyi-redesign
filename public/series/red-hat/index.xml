      <description>Introduction This has been quite an experience getting my RHCSA (Red Hat Certified System Administrator) 8. I learned a lot and have been really humbled by the amount of information I needed to retain to pass the exam. Red Hat does not joke around with the difficulty of their exams. This is by no means to scare you away, in the end it was totally worth it.
I am going to take some time and break down what I did to pass this exam and to highlight the wonderful resources I used.</description>
