# Introduction

The redesign of my site started when I was managing the previous Wordpress version of it. With WordPress being so popular (and therefore more commonly attacked) and seeing 9 updates that were required for all of the plugins, I decided I had enough. My site is extremely simple and I want to keep it that way for a simple personal website. There were some features of WordPress that were nice (like the WYSIWYG editor), but I am more technical at heart and I know there is a simpler way. This is when I came across the option of using a static site generator. I am still in the process of learning Golang (and plan on doing some posts around that) when I came across the Hugo project. Being that it is written in Go, I wanted to see what it took to get a simple site stood up. And that is where the fun began.

# What is Hugo?

[Hugo](https://gohugo.io) is a static site generator that is known for it's incredibly fast loading pages. The concept of a static site generator is that you have a template that you use for your blog posts, but you can also use this template for your basic pages (Home page, About page, etc.). To set up a basic site, you need to have a certain directory structure and a file called a config.toml in the root of that directory. This config file sets parameters that are crucial to generating your static site and setting parameters in your theme that you have either designed or chosen. You can see an example of a [config.toml](https://github.com/Xmas13/noel.fyi-redesign/blob/master/config.toml) on my Github.

## Directory Structure

Along with the config.toml file, you will need to have several directories that will be used by hugo when it is creating your static site assets to be served by either Nginx or Apache.

This directory structure should look something like this:

```
assets/
content/
  - posts/
    - your_blog_post_here.md
  - snippets/
  - your_static_pages_here.md (about.md, contact.md)
resources/
  - assets/
  - images/
static/
  - directory_structure_for_static_assets/
themes/
  - theme_name/
config.toml
```

* assets - The way I understand this directory is it is meant for theme files. In my case it has some custom javascript in there.
* content - This is where your posts and static pages go. These files should be written in Markdown and styled by your theme.
* resources - These are resources that are generated by your theme (scss files and such). They are used when building the public version of your hugo site
* static - This is where your static assets go for your posts. (Images, videos, etc.)
* themes - This is where your theme goes that you are using. This will be referenced in your config.toml file.

Feel free to review more [documentation](https://gohugo.io/documentation/) on Hugo's site. It is very good and will give you an even better understanding of it than what I am giving you here. My site after all is very basic.

## Viewing and Live Editing your Site

After getting your directory in order and a theme picked out, it is time for the fun part. You will start being able to create posts and adding content to your site.

As was described in the previous section, you will be putting these posts inside the content/posts folder (this could depend on your theme). These files will be written in Markdown. The main difference between a Hugo Markdown file and traditional Markdown is the metadata section. I have given an example from this post below:

``` markdown
+++
date = "2020-08-26"
title = "noel.fyi Redesign"
slug = "website-redesign"
tags = []
categories = []
series = ["Linux","IT","Education"]
+++
```

This is just metadata on the post itself.

* date: What's the date of your post
* title: What do you want to show in browser title bar
* slug: How do you want it to show in the url (https://noel.fyi/website-redesign)
* tags: Depending on your theme, you can use tags for your user of the site to search with
* categories: Same as above
* series: Same as above

Once this is established, You can write the rest of your post.

### Live Editing

To test out and live edit your site, you simply open a terminal in the root of your hugo directory and run: `hugo serve`. This will serve your site on [http://localhost:1313](http://localhost:1313) so you can view it. When you make a change and save your post or edits to your static pages, it will regenerate and show the changes immediately. This is a super nice feature as you don't have to stop and start the server each time you make an edit.

### Publish your Site

There are quite a few different methods of publishing your hugo site. The most straight forward I have found is to just use the `hugo` command in the root of your directory. What this will do is it will create a folder called **public** in your directory. This will have all of the static assets that you would serve using either apache or nginx. You can simply transfer these to a VPS (Virtual Private Server) running nginx and place them in the proper directory. This is just one example. For more information on publishing your site visit [Hugo's Documentation](https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment) on the subject.

#### My Publishing Method

If you want to utilize the method that I built myself, I have my whole architecture documented on my [Github](https://github.com/Xmas13/noel.fyi-redesign). This utilizes Docker and several other pipeline technologies to take the pain out of copying and pasting static assets to your serve directory. I have plans to actually make it even more robust so that updates are seamless, it can scale out easily, and is highly available

# Final Thoughts

I am very happy with how my site has turned out. Compared to how it looked and functioned before, it is a lot simpler and more sleek looking. I hope you can find some use for Hugo in your own projects as I will definitely be building other static site projects with it if there is a need for it.
