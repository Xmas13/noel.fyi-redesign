# Who Am I?

![](/images/me2.jpg)

My name is Noel Miller. I am from the great state of Minnesota in the USA. I am 5 years into my IT career at this point and work as a freelance IT Consultant. I have worked on all sizes of companies ranging from SMBs (Small - Medium Size Businesses) to Large Enterprises. I am a father, multi instrumentalist, have a zoo of animals at home (2 Dogs, 5 Cats), and I enjoy spending time with my family and friends. I am actively pursuing a degree in Music to pivot into a career in Music Education. I also plan on continuing to produce my own Music as well.

The purpose of this site is to provide my own thoughts, opinions, and information on things I am interested in. I have always been interested in Technology, Linux / Open Source, and Music (specifically metal). I feel that as being a part of the Open Source Community, I should attempt to give back to the community with the knowledge and experience I have gained.
